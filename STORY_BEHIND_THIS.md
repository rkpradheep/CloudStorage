This is my first website that I hosted on the internet .I have chosen InfinityFree to host my website which is ofcourse free of charge and it is ideal for the beginners and aspirers like me to host a website on internet without seeking for any financial help from the parents.

You can view my website using the the link "https://rkpradheep.epizy.com",since GitHub doesn't have the feature to run the php files and database facility.

This website may not look professional or appealing, as I hadn't downloaded any template or stolen the work of someone from the internet and my intention is not to monetize on this.

The codes used for this website is not a work of others or pyrated one.This is completely unique and I did on my own but I reffered the internet to learn and implement the concepts that I needed.

Javascript language really galvanized me to make this website.I am inspired by all the features and methods supported by JavaScript as html doesn't. I have come to know about the js on the 4th semester of my currently pursuing 3rd year in department of Information Technology,as I had it on my syllabus.

I came up with the idea to make a website which is simply a time table but with some additional functionalities like notifying the students that class begins,to go to the respective class when clicking the button adjacent to name of the subject. I utilized this lockdown and could accomplish what I wished. I was also happy that all my friends used my hosted website to join the class and benefitted by it.

I had also made a android version of it by making use of webview feature available in android studio. You can download the app from my website.

Later I did a mini cloud storage using google FIREBASE which you can store all format of files and retrieve it anywhere anytime by the ID you created when uploading your files.

I also love java and I am currently honing my skills on it.
